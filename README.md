# Develop “Mini Trello/Kanban” interface - With Drag &amp; Drop of cards between columns, Add / Remove / Update Card


- Frontend: React / Hooks + Tailwind css (or equivalent) / Apollo Client GraphQL (no
redux preferably)
- Backend: Node / Express / MongoDB / Mongoose
- The Trello/Kanban like interface must be implemented from scratch not re-using a fully
featured Kanban board package.
- However the drag and drop functionality can leverage a react library
- An option to order the cards by date of creation or by custom
Bonus: Package / Run App in Docker container and/or AWS
- Step 1:  Delivery of Code on Github; Record and send short 10m Loom video to demo the UI/functionality, code overview
(show browser network tab with graphql queries/mutations)
- Step 2: Interview to discuss the code / implementation with Algo question (efficient reordering
of cards)
